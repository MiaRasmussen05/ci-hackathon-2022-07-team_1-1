# [Welcome to Catching Feelings!](https://sarosim.github.io/ci-hackathon-2022-07-team_1/index.html) ðŸª‚

## This is Team 'Our Emojis Got The Best of Us!'

Miklos Sarosi [Sarosim](https://github.com/Sarosim), Phil [Bradders81](https://github.com/Bradders81), Mark Lau [mark3lau](https://github.com/mark3lau), Mia Rasmussen [MiaRasmussen05](https://github.com/MiaRasmussen05), Aziz Oyekan [oludare89](https://github.com/oludare89) and Jacob Conway [jjconway23](https://github.com/jjconway23)

This web application is for a fun and interactive game made in celebration of World Emoji Day.

## User experience

### User Stories
* As a site visitor, I can easily understand the main purpose of the site.
* As a site visitor, I can read instructions so that I can understand how to play the game.
* As a site visitor, I can navigate to the game page without effort.
* As a player of the game, I want to capture as many emojis as I can so that I achieve the highest score.

### Strategy Plane
The goal of the web application is to provide a fun and challenging game that players can strive to achieve the highest score they can. The game's theme is the celebration of World Emoji Day and emojis will therefore be incorporated and provide a main element of the game and gameplay.

### Scope Plane
The scope is a playable interactive game with landing page to provide navigation and information on rules of the game.

### Structure Plane
The landing page will provide navigation to the gameplay page and provide instructions for site users to understand how to play the game.

The gameplay page is where the users will be able to play the game, view the time left for their current session of the game and their current score.

### Skeleton Plane
In the gameplay, you will have a controllable phone at the bottom of the game play screen which you have to use via the arrow keys in order to capture the positive emojis that will increase your score. In addition, correctly avoiding catching the negative emojis which also improve the player's score.

Conversely, catching negative emojis will decrease the player's score as well as not catching the positive emojis.

### Surface Plane

#### Colour scheme
The main background colours used are [#8DBDFF](https://www.colorhexa.com/8dbdff) and [#FFEB85](https://www.colorhexa.com/ffeb85).

#### Imagery
